            <p class="text-secondary bg-dark">With the global economy increasingly centered on knowledge and skill, educational institutions are moving
                <br>
                from traditional teaching methods to custom methodologies that promote anytime, personalized, and adaptive learning.
                <br>
                Disruption in education with the adoption of online learning platforms and the move to cloud-based solutions have brought about radical changes in education.
                <br>
                Equity in education and accessibility to learning are key. The COVID-19 pandemic has served as one of the biggest disruptors as well as accelerators in the education sector 
                <br>
                by making online learning feasible, easily accessible, attractive, and effective.Education has expanded out of physical spaces to evolve into a blended classroom marked by anywhere, anytime learning.
                Blended, technology-supported education that is ‘phygital’ in nature and aimed at improving personalization, engagement, and ultimately outcomes, will not only enrich
                <br>
                students, but also teachers and institutions — a win-win for individuals, government, and society.</p>

               <br>
                expanding threat perimeters in the digital world.
               <br>
             Cyber defense is no more about ensuring compliance; it is about
             <br>
              proactive mitigation of various types of risk.
            <br>
            Enterprises looking to defend their digital estate must plan for it
            <br> in their transformation journey.
